Hi, Iâ€™m @Regiglock

I recently began a career in the IT field by joining the USAF under CyberTransport. 
I hope to expand my knowledge with heverything IT, particularly security because my ultimate goal is to be a part of a high end CSIRT program. 
Doesn't matter where, as long as I feel I can grow.
Green hat and script kiddie is an overstaement. Hopefully that'll change in the near future.
